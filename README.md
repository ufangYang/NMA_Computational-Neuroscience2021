Abstract: 
When deciding on a course of action, the sensory information on which the decision is based might be ambiguous, leading to uncertainty. In experiments with human participants, uncertainty can be quantified by asking the participants to provide feedback on their confidence of choice. However, in some experimental tasks, e.g. when studying babies or animals, uncertainty is or cannot be measured explicitly. However, even in these experiments, there could be distinct features of behavior that could provide researchers with an indirect measure of uncertainty. We will therefore investigate whether animals show different characteristic behaviours when faced with a perceptual decision-making task with different levels of ambiguity in the  sensory input.
To investigate this research question, we use the Steinmetz dataset (Steinmetz, et al., 2019) in which mice performed a visual discrimimation task. Mice had to decide which of the presented pair of stimuli had the higher contrast. Based on this, we have identified several putative behavioral markers of uncertainty (e.g., reaction time, error rates, licking rate, pupil size, velocity and changes of wheel direction) to build a multidimensional behavioral space. We hypothesize that using these behavioral measures, we can find distinguishable behavioral patterns that separate the levels of ambiguity (different levels of contrast difference between pairs of stimuli). For this purpose, we will perform a cluster analysis (k-means clustering) on all trials to find distinct clusters for the contrast difference conditions reflecting certain characteristic behavioral patterns. Future studies could try to corroborate a link between these markers and explicit measures of uncertainty in a task. Furthermore, these markers could provide a promising basis for future studies examining neural correlates of uncertainty.
